RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Tortoiseshell Optics
Tortoiseshell Optics is an optometry office that provides low cost exams and frame fittings.

In this project, you will help Tortoiseshell Optics build a responsive website with unique desktop, tablet, and mobile appearances.

The images and colors needed to build the project will be provided with design mock ups and spec designs. Specs outline important design specifications to help you replicate the design in HTML and CSS. We intentionally did not include specific media breakpoints so you could find breakpoints that look good to you!
